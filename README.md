## Project 1 - K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree

In project 1, we implement two machine learning methods, K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) on two datasets to investigate and compare
the classification performance. We preprocess the dataset and implement these two
methods to train the model. After the investigation, we find that the Decision Tree
model generates slightly better results, but the time cost of the DT is much larger than
KNN. Also, the weighted KNN model would help to reduce the effect on the model
accuracy from the extreme values in the training dataset.

## Project2 - Logistic Regression and Multiclass Regression

In this project, we evaluate several classification methods, including the logistics
regression model, multiclass regression, and KNN on two datasets to investigate and evaluate
the classification performance. We first process the dataset, construct the methods, and
implement them on the dataset to train the model. We investigate the performance of several
classification methods on the two datasets, and our key takeaways include follows. Logistics
regression performs better on datasets with a binary target variable; multiclass regression
performs better on datasets with multiple categories target variable; a large number of features
leads to bad performance for KNN in both cases; the size of the training dataset could slightly
improve the model performance.

## Project3 - Multi-Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural-Networks

In the project, we implement the different neural-network methods, including
Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP) with different numbers of layers and activation functions, and
Convolutional Neural-Networks(CNN) on a fashion dataset to investigate and evaluate the
method performance.
